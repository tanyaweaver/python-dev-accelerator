### Guidelines

- **YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE ANY JAVASCRIPT FOR THIS PROJECT.** It is not at all required. If you decide to use it, use it wisely.
- You can replace the cat images with whatever you want, as long as it's tasteful. Use good judgement. Placeholder images are fine. The current images came from [placekitten.com](http://www.placekitten.com)
- You can replace the page text with whatever you want, however keep the subject matter throughout the site self-consistent, and again keep it tasteful.
- Any links that would lead to external pages (e.g. social media sites) should just remain as either dead links (so, link to "#") or simply to the homepages of those sites (e.g. Facebook icon links to facebook.com). **There should be no other external links.**
- You don't have to use the same exact social media icons used here, but they should be the same brands
- The Contact form shouldn't actually submit data to anything
- Use standard conventions for indenting nested tags and structuring your CSS. Keep it clean.

### Submitting Your Work

- You will deploy your site to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). This may require learning an additional toolset for deployment. The documentation is well written, and should provide enough guidance for you to learn and deploy without any prior knowledge of the tool.
- You will create a public GitHub repository for your work and submit the link to that repository
- In the README of that repository, you'll include the link to the site that you've built. Use your README as an opportunity to document your submission, utilizing markdown for basic formatting.
