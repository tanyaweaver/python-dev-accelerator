Create a repository named ``code-katas``. 
Add to that repository a ``README.md`` describing the repo as holding the code
for your code katas.
Anytime you complete a code kata (whether assigned or on your own), add that code
the ``code-katas`` repository on its own branch, then merge that branch to master.

Setting Python as your language, complete the `Sum of the First Nth Terms of a Series`_ kata with whatever solution works for you.

Submitting Your Work
====================

Create a ``sum-of-nth-terms`` branch in your ``code-katas`` repository.
When your solution passes the tests at Code Wars, copy your code into a script
on the ``sum-of-nth-terms`` branch. 
Finally, copy the tests administered by Code Wars into a ``test_sum_terms.py`` file.

After you've copied your code solution over into GitHub, send a pull request
to your master branch.
**Submit the URL of that pull request to Canvas.**

Use the comment box in Canvas to talk about your thought process, as well as any difficulty you had with this code kata.
