    This document contains no slides.

It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project.
The first step for group projects is to pitch ideas.

Tasks
=====

As a class, arrange a 1-hour time when you can all be in the same place.
Lab time is ideal for this.

Grab a whiteboard and brainstorm ideas.
During this phase, there is no comment or criticism of ideas.
Ideas should be given in the form of titles or very short phrases.
If explanation is needed, save it for the pitch round.

Once a critical mass of ideas has been written down, the person who offered the idea will give a pitch.
Each pitch may be no longer than 2 to 3 minutes.
The purpose of a pitch is to sell the idea to your classmates.
During this phase, questions may be asked, but discussion should be limited.
Keep it short and to the point.

At the end of the pitch you should have formed a short list of favorites.

Submitting Your Work
====================

Use the provided text area to write down *your own favorites*.
Provide the title of the idea and a description *in your own words* of what it is about.
