.. slide:: Python 401 Schedule
    :level: 1

    This document contains no slides.

The 401 Python class moves fast through a large quantity of material.
Having a level of comfort with the basic skills you'll be using every day is vital to your success.

From the pre-work assignments below, please select the area in which you are the weakest.
Begin by working on that.
Once you have spent at least 10 hours on that area, select your next weakest area and move on to that.

You do not need to do a lot of work every day.
One hour is enough, though just.
The key is to work every single day.
Do not let a day go by without spending your time practicing.
